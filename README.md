# Structured-Query-Language-SQL-From-Scratch
Sure, here's a detailed tutorial on SQL:

**1. Introduction to SQL:**
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing relational databases.
   - It is used for tasks such as querying data, updating data, inserting data, and deleting data from databases.
   - SQL is widely used in various database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, etc.

**2. Basic SQL Commands:**
   - **SELECT:** Used to retrieve data from a database table.
   - **INSERT:** Used to add new rows of data to a table.
   - **UPDATE:** Used to modify existing data in a table.
   - **DELETE:** Used to remove rows from a table.
   
**3. SQL Data Types:**
   - Numeric types (INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL, etc.)
   - Character strings (VARCHAR, CHAR, TEXT, etc.)
   - Date and time types (DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, etc.)
   - Other types (BOOLEAN, BLOB, JSON, etc.)

**4. SQL Queries:**
   - **SELECT Statement:** Used to retrieve data from one or more database tables.
   - **WHERE Clause:** Used to filter records based on specified conditions.
   - **ORDER BY Clause:** Used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
   - **GROUP BY Clause:** Used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
   - **JOIN Clause:** Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
   - **HAVING Clause:** Used in combination with the GROUP BY clause to filter the results.
   
**5. SQL Functions:**
   - **Aggregate Functions:** Functions like SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), COUNT() used to perform calculations on a set of values.
   - **Scalar Functions:** Functions like CONCAT(), SUBSTRING(), UPPER(), LOWER(), etc., used to manipulate strings or perform other operations on individual values.
   - **Date Functions:** Functions like DATE(), DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR(), etc., used to perform operations on date values.
   
**6. SQL Constraints:**
   - **NOT NULL:** Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
   - **UNIQUE:** Ensures that each value in a column is unique.
   - **PRIMARY KEY:** Combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Used to uniquely identify each record in a table.
   - **FOREIGN KEY:** Constraint that establishes a relationship between two tables.
   - **CHECK:** Ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.
   
**7. SQL Joins:**
   - **INNER JOIN:** Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
   - **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
   - **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
   - **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
   
**8. SQL Subqueries:**
   - A subquery is a query nested within another query.
   - Can be used within SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements or even within another subquery.
   - Can return a single value, a single row, multiple rows, or an entire result set.

**9. SQL Transactions:**
   - A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit.
   - Ensures data integrity by either committing all changes if successful or rolling back all changes if an error occurs.
   - Consists of four properties known as ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

**10. Advanced SQL Topics:**
   - Views
   - Indexes
   - Stored Procedures
   - Triggers
   - Cursors
   - Window Functions
   - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

This is a basic overview of SQL. Depending on your requirements, you can dive deeper into each topic to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions!
